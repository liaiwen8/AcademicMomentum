# To Run Program (WINDOWS):
Download *academic_momentum.zip*, unzip into folder, and run *grade_model.exe*. Note that folder *_internal* must be unzipped into same directory as *grade_model.exe* (should be by default)

# NOTE
Due to differing environmental variables or other factors, accuracy of the model displayed may change between executions of the program. This is not a bug, it is due to how your system commences running of the program or the calculation models performed by the accuracy function.
