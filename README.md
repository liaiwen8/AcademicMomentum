# To Run Program (WINDOWS):
Please install **7ZIP** application if not already installed (due to the file limitations of GitHub). https://www.7-zip.org/download.html
Download *academic_momentum.zip*, (click the file from github and press download icon to download raw file). Unzip the downloaded file into a folder **using 7ZIP**, and run *grade_model.exe*. Note that folder *_internal* must be unzipped into same directory as *grade_model.exe* (should be by default). If antivirus flags file as unsafe, please ignore and recover file (it is **false positive**). Rest assured my program is safe to run, you may check it on a third-party virus detector such as VirusTotal. 

TO VIEW RESULTS:
Press ENTER DATA button once student information is finalized, then **close the window**. A percentage window will appear. Follow onscreen instructions and contact me below if help is needed.

# NOTE
Due to differing environmental variables or other factors, accuracy of the model displayed may change between executions of the program. This is not a bug, it is due to how your system commences running of the program or the calculation models performed by the accuracy function.
